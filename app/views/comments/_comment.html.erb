<!-- Clicking this new "Destroy Comment" link will fire off a DELETE
/articles/:article_id/comments/:id to our CommentsController, which can then use this to find the comment we want to delete, so let's add a destroy action to our controller (app/controllers/comments_controller.rb): -->
<p>
  <%= link_to 'Delete Comment', [comment.article, comment], method: :delete, data: { confirm: 'Are you sure?'} %>
</p>
